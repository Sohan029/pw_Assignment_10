        identifies the practices that every CEO can try to emulate.

          writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976,
          was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
          1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
          world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform
          seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones,
          tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus
          belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators, along with
          Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
          saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will
          remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.

            One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most
            of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on
            people. “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart
            people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at another
            place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then
            he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got
            some amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of
            hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any
            other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano,
            iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X
            Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final
            illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of
            colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving
            wife, sister, and four children.
