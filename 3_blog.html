        <span class="text-2xl tracking-widest font-bold">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</span> writ large: Steve Jobs
        cofounded Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985,
        returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he
        died, in October 2011, had built it into the world’s most valuable
        company. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal
        computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail
        stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of
        America’s great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and
        Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their
        personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied
        imagination to technology and business.
